NAME
    Mason::Plugin::HTMLFilters - Filters related to HTML generation

FILTERS
    HTML or H
        Do a basic HTML escape on the content - just the characters '&',
        '>', '<', and '"'.

            <input name="company" value="<% $company | H %>">

    HTMLEntities
        Do a comprehensive HTML escape on the content, using
        HTML::Entities::encode_entities.

    URI or U
        URI-escape the content.

            <a href="<% $url | U %>">

    HTMLPara
        Formats a block of text into HTML paragraphs. A sequence of two or
        more newlines is used as the delimiter for paragraphs which are then
        wrapped in HTML ""<p>""...""</p>"" tags. Taken from
        Template::Toolkit. e.g.

            <% $.HTMLPara { %>
            First paragraph.
      
            Second paragraph.
            </%>
    
        outputs:

            <p>
            First paragraph.
            </p>
      
            <p>
            Second paragraph.
            </p>

    HTMLParaBreak
        Similar to HTMLPara above, but uses the HTML tag sequence "<br><br>"
        to join paragraphs. Taken from Template::Toolkit. e.g.

            <% $.HTMLPara { %>
            First paragraph.
      
            Second paragraph.
            </%>
    
        outputs:

            First paragraph.
            <br><br>
            Second paragraph.
